# Game types

Current standard game types are:

| Game type | Arena size  | Min. participants | Max. participants |
|:----------|:-----------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|
| `classic` |  800 x 600  |         2         |     unlimited     |
| `1v1`     |  800 x 600  |         2         |         2         |
| `melee`   | 1000 x 1000 |        10         |     unlimited     |

In the future, more game types might arrive. And it is also possible to define `custom` game types with your own
settings for battles.

The current game types are mainly defined based on the arena size and the number of participants for the battle.
For example, 1v1 is meant for two bots exactly battling each other on a 1000 x 1000 sized arena.
