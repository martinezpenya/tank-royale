rem install-dependencies.cmd â€” Windows dependency installer for sample-bots/python
rem Mirrors the behavior of install-dependencies.sh on macOS/Linux.

rem Behavior:
rem - Changes to the directory where this script resides
rem - If .deps_installed does not exist, installs requirements from requirements.txt
rem - Also installs local robocode_tank_royale-*.whl if present
rem - Only creates .deps_installed if installation succeeds
rem - Exits with non-zero code and message on failure

rem Change to the directory where this script is located
cd /d "%~dp0"

rem Check if dependencies are already installed
