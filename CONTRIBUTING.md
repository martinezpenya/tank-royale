# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Robocode Tank Royale. This guide explains how to get involved, what to expect, and how to make your contributions effective.

### Motivation behind Robocode

Robocode is a spare-time, non-profit project with these goals:

- Provide a [programming game] that’s genuinely fun while helping users develop programming and AI skills.
- Serve education: a platform for learning, with clear goals and obvious ways to benchmark performance.
- Encourage competition: events like [LiteRumble] (for the [original Robocode game](https://robocode.sourceforge.io/)) are e-sports for programming games and a great way to showcase your skills.
- Make development enjoyable: building Robocode should be a fun way to learn and experiment.

### Guiding principles

Big changes to the core game rules and physics are a no-go.

Why:

- Rules and physics should remain stable. If you want new ones, fork the project and give it a new name.
- Large changes break backward compatibility, making it hard to mix older bots with newer versions.
- Drastic changes frustrate users who invested time mastering subtle details to gain a competitive edge.
- Documentation becomes harder when it must describe multiple behaviors side by side.

Robocode should evolve, but breaking changes must be avoided. Focus on improvements that align with the expectations of most users. Significant additions are welcome as long as they remain backward compatible.

## Roadmap

See the [roadmap] for upcoming ideas and directions.

Note: There’s no timeline or ETA. Robocode is a spare-time project, not a full-time product.

## How to contribute

- **Support**
  - Answer questions when you can.
  - Be polite and constructive in discussions and reviews.
  - Participate in conversations: issues, bug reports, and feature requests.

- **Documentation**
  - All docs are Markdown in the repository. Fix typos, clarify wording, add missing content, and open a [pull request].
  - Documentation and communication use American English.

- **Bug reports**
  - Report issues you encounter.
  - Before filing, search for existing issues.
  - Include clear steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, and relevant logs or error messages. Add environment details (OS, Java version, etc.) when useful.
  - If you understand the cause, feel free to propose a fix in a [pull request].

- **Feature requests**
  - Start a discussion or issue describing the idea and motivation in detail.
  - Expect healthy debate about acceptance and implementation details.
  - Treat feature requests as wishes, not requirements. Good ideas are likely to be implemented; others may be declined.
  - No ETA is guaranteed. If you want it sooner, consider contributing a [pull request] and/or collaborating with others.

- **Implementing a feature request**
  - Confirm the feature is accepted or likely to be accepted; when in doubt, contact the [maintainer].
  - Add or update documentation for new behavior.
  - Provide tests where reasonable; manual testing is acceptable when automation isn’t practical.
  - Changes to a [Bot API] are non-trivial: all official APIs (JVM, .NET, web, etc.) must stay in sync, not just one platform.

## Regarding pull requests

### Keep PRs buildable and testable
Ensure the code compiles and the application can be run for review. Don’t break existing functionality.

### Provide context
Link to the related issue or discussion. Explain how to verify or test the change. Add code comments where decisions might be non-obvious. Use `TODO`/`FIXME` where appropriate.

### Prefer small, focused PRs
Avoid “big bang” changes. Don’t mix unrelated work (e.g., a bug fix plus multiple features). Submit separate PRs. For very large changes, coordinate with the [maintainer] before implementation.

## Regarding Bot APIs

### In the spirit of the original Robocode API
Official APIs are inspired by the original game to ease migration, but 1:1 compatibility isn’t expected or possible.

### Cross-platform consistency
All official APIs should offer equivalent features in consistent ways, while following each platform’s conventions.

### Alternative Bot APIs
You’re welcome to create alternative APIs in separate repositories. We can link to them as community options.

## Booters, GUIs, and servers

### Alternative booter/GUI
Alternative booters or GUIs are welcome in separate repositories. Please link them from this project.

### Server
The official server is the heart of the game; drop-in replacements are a no-go. You can, however, build services on top of it (e.g., controllers for scheduling, ranking, analytics) in a separate repository.
