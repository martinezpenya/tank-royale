# Versions

## 📦 0.17.5 - Maintenance

#### 🪲 Bug Fixes

- Bot API for .Net:
    - Setting the max speed and max turn rates for the body, gun, and radar did not work.
    - Fixed issue with moving and turning, which could override the set target speed and turn rates, when these had been
      set explicitly on the API.
    - Reading the turn rates and target speed for the current turn did not reflect if the turn rate and/or target speed
      had been set for the current turn.
- Rendering issues on Windows (and Linux?) when using accelerated hardware, by setting these Java properties:
    - `sun.java2d.d3d=false` (turn off use of Direct3D)
    - `sun.java2d.noddraw=true` (no use of Direct Draw)
    - `sun.java2d.opengl=true` (turn on OpenGL)

#### 🚀 Improvements

- Bot API:
    - addCondition() and removeCondition() now returns a boolean value instead of void.
    - Condition can take an optional lambda expression as input parameter as alternative to overriding the test()
      method.
    - Added more test units, which did show bugs within the Bot API for both Java and .Net.
    - The event priority order was reversed to match the order used with the original Robocode.

## 📦 0.17.4 - Maintenance - 16-Oct-2022

#### 🚀 Improvements

- Server:
    - Added `--tps` option to the server for setting the initial Turns Per Second (TPS).
    - Fire assistant is now only activated, when both the radar and gun are pointing in the same direction for two turns
      in a row (like original Robocode).
- GUI App:
    - Switched the order of the Game Type dropdown and Setup Rules button.
    - The positioning of the battle view is now controlled by dragging the mouse, instead of clicking.
    - Now sends the current tps to the server when changing game type.
    - Added `Help` menu item under the Help menu, which opens browser to the documentation of the GUI application.
- Release
    - All Java artifacts are now sent to Maven Central, i.e. Bot API, GUI Application, Server, and Booter.
    - New assets are now added to releases: Server and Booter
    - Added build scripts to automated creating (draft) releases using GitHub REST API.
    - Improved layout for release notes.
    - Optimized ProGuard rules for compressing the Booter and Server jar archives even more, making the jar archive for
      the GUI smaller as well.

#### 🪲 Bug Fixes

- Bot API and GUI App: Fixed various concurrency issues.

## 📦 0.17.3 - Maintenance - 02-Oct-2022

#### ⚡ Changes

- [#43](https://github.com/robocode-dev/tank-royale/issues/43): Possibility to identify bot from Process to Tick:
    - Went back to boot process `pid` instead of using the `boot id`.
- ~~Bot API: The event priority order was reversed to be similar to the original Robocode.~~

#### 🚀 Improvements

- Sample bots: Improved the Fire sample bot by removing unnecessary code.

#### 🪲 Bug Fixes

- Server:
    - The fire assistant was not always activated.
    - [#45](https://github.com/robocode-dev/tank-royale/issues/45): Server is kidnapping CPU cycles
        - Game is now aborted, when the last bot participating in a battle is leaving (disconnecting).
        - Timer used for turn timeout was not stopped, when a battle had ended/aborted.
        - Freeing heap memory used for storing game state when game is ended/aborted.

## 📦 0.17.2 - Added sounds - 20-Sep-2022

#### 🚀 Improvements

- GUI/Sounds: [#4](https://github.com/robocode-dev/tank-royale/issues/4): Fire and Explosion Sounds:
    - Added feature to play sounds to the GUI application.
    - Added Sound Options to configure sounds.
    - Note that sound files are distributed independently besides the gui application from the
      [sounds releases](https://github.com/robocode-dev/sounds/releases)
- GUI: Moved the Dismiss button on the Bot Root Directories configuration down under the Add and Remove buttons, and
  adjusted the size of the dialog.

#### 🪲 Bug Fixes

- GUI: When the Bot Directories on the Select Bots for Battle window is updated, all selections are now being cleared.

## 📦 0.17.1 - Identifying a bot from Boot-up to Ticks - 15-Sep-2022

#### 🚀 Improvements

- [#43](https://github.com/robocode-dev/tank-royale/issues/43): Possibility to identify bot from Process to Tick:
    - ~~Reintroduced `boot id` to replace boot process id (`pid`)~~
    - Added `sessionId` and `bootId` to these schemas: `bot-handshake`, `bot-state-with-id`, and `participants`

#### 🪲 Bug Fixes

- Bot API:
    - The `onWonRound(WonRoundEvent)` was not triggered as soon as the round has ended.
    - The blocking turn methods for turning the body, gun, and radar invoked `go()` twice internally making the turning
      turn in "step" and take the double amount of time.
    - Some events already handled were not removed from the event queue.

## 📦 0.17.0 - Introduction of process id - 06-Sep-2022

The _boot id_ concept introduced in release 0.16.0 has been rolled back and the _pid_ is used with the Booter again.
However, a new concept is introduced to replace the _boot id_, which is the _process id_.

When a client (bot, controller, observer) is connecting to a server, the server will generate a unique session id and
send to the client via the `server-handshake`. The session id is used to uniquely identify the running instance of a
client, and the client _must_ send back the session id when sending its handshake to the server, e.g. a `bot-handshake`.

The _session id_ is replacing the _boot id_ as the boot id is only available with bots being booted, and which might
only be unique locally, but across multiple systems. With the _session id_, all clients have a single and unique id.

#### 🚀 Improvements

- GUI:
    - Improved sorting of the bot directories list to be case-insensitive.

#### 🪲 Bug Fixes

- Server:
    - The `server-handshake` was missing the name and version.

## 📦 0.16.0 - Introduction of boot id - 31-Aug-2022

~~The _boot id_ has been introduced to make it easier to identify which bots have booted locally. Previously, only the
host and port were available on the server side, making it hard to identify the bots started from a controller.
Now the boot id uniquely identifies a booted bot.~~

~~Previously, a process id (pid) was used to uniquely identify a bot being booted, but the pid has been replaced by the
new boot id.~~

- ~~Schema:~~
    - ~~The `bot-handshake` has been extended to include the `bootId` when the bot is booted locally. This field may be
      empty when a bot has not been booted by the Booter.~~
- ~~Booter~~:
    - ~~Now generates a unique boot id for each booted bot, and sends this to the bot via the new `BOOT_ID` environment
      variable.~~
- ~~Bot API~~:
    - ~~Takes the boot id from the `BOOT_ID` environment variable and includes this within the bot `bot-handshake` whens
      it is sent to the server.~~

#### 🪲 Bug Fixes

- Bot API:
    - Fixed `waitFor(Condition)` so it executes before checking the condition the first time.
- Server
    - Fixed major bug where the firepower was not limited at the server side.
    - Adjusted gun to fire at gun direction for a new turn.
- GUI:
    - Issue with reading huge bot list from the booter when reading from stdin.

## 📦 0.15.0 - Added fire assistance - 17-Aug-2022

#### 🚀 Improvements

Fire assistance:

- Added fire assistance known from the original Robocode game. Fire assistance is useful for bots with limited
  aiming capabilities as it will help the bot by firing directly at a scanned bot when the gun is fired, which is a
  very simple aiming strategy.
- When fire assistance is enabled the gun will fire towards the center of the scanned bot when all these conditions
  are met:
    - The gun is fired (`setFire` and `fire`)
    - The radar is scanning a bot _when_ firing the gun (`onScannedBot`, `setRescan`, `rescan`)
    - The gun and radar are pointing in the exact the same direction. You can call `setAdjustRadarForGunTurn(false)` to
      align the gun and radar and make sure not to turn the radar beside the gun.
- When calling `setAdjustRadarForGunTurn(true)` then fire assistance will automatically be disabled, and when calling
  `setAdjustRadarForGunTurn(false)` then fire assistance will automatically be disabled.
- Added new `setFireAssist(enable)` to enable and disable the fire assistance explicitly.

GUI:

- Updated various hover help texts for the dialog used for starting battles.

Bot info:

- The `gamesTypes` field is no longer required with the JSON config file of a bot. When it omitted, the bot will be able
  to participate in _all_ game types. When defined, the bot will only be able to participate in battles with the game
  type(s) defined within this field.
- The `gameTypes` field has been removed from the sample bots, as all sample bots can participate in any game type.
  At least for now.

#### 🪲 Bug Fixes

- GUI & Booter:
    - Fixed major bug as the GUI and booter did not filter out bots based on their selected game types.
    - Fixed issue with parsing JSON bot info file for the optional fields `description`, `countryCodes`, `homepage`,
      causing an issue with loading a bot, when these fields were omitted.
    - Fixed issue with parsing json content within the JSON bot info due to text encoding.
- Bot API:
    - Corrected the description of the `onScannedBot()` event handler.
- Server:
    - TPS: When TPS was set to 0 and the battle was restarted, the battle ran in max TPS.

## 📦 0.14.3 - Fixed setting adjustment turns - 07-Aug-2022

#### 🪲 Bug Fixes

- GUI:
    - NullPointerException when running robocode-tankroyale-gui-0.14.2.jar
      ([#38](https://github.com/robocode-dev/tank-royale/issues/38))
- Server:
    - `AdjustRadarForBodyTurn` had no effect on the server side.
    - `updateBotTurnRatesAndDirections` did not work properly with adjustments for body and gun turn when
      using `setAdjustGunForBodyTurn`, `setAdjustRadarForGunTurn`, and `setAdjustRadarForBodyTurn`.
- Sample bots
    - Updated Corners to start at random corner when a new battle is started.

## 📦 0.14.2 - Added Velocity Bot - 29-Jul-2022

#### 🚀 Improvements

- Bot API:
    - The run() method is now forced to stop/abort (in case the run method enters and infinite loop).
- Server:
    - Bots are not "sliding" along walls anymore when hitting those.
- Sample bots
    - Added _VelocityBot_ that demonstrates use of turn rates.

#### 🪲 Bug Fixes

- Bot API:
    - Setting the turn rates with the `Bot` class did not work properly (bot, gun, and radar did not turn at all).
- Server:
    - Fixed calculation of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd places with the end results.
    - Fixed issue with restarting a game that has ended.
    - Removal of NullPointerExceptions occurring with max TPS.
- GUI:
    - TPS:
        - Loop could occur when typing in the TPS, where TPS would continuously change to different values.
        - Setting the TPS to max could be reset to default TPS when restarting the battle or GUI.
    - GUI client was registered multiple times with the server.

## 📦 0.14.1 - Added BotInfo builder - 14-Jul-2022

#### 🚀 Improvements

- Bot API:
    - BotInfo:
        - A builder has been provided for creating `BotInfo` instances.
        - Size constraints have been added for the individual `BotInfo` fields/methods.
        - Various bugfixes for BotInfo.
    - GameTypes:
        - Added missing game type for "classic" game + updated documentation.

## 📦 0.14.0 - Adjustments for bot events - 03-Jul-2022

#### Changes

- Bot API:
    - Adjusted the bot events to make it easier to make a bridge between legacy Robocode bots and Tank Royale later
      ([#12](https://github.com/robocode-dev/tank-royale/issues/12)).
    - Introduced `BotDeathEvent` and `HitByBulletEvent`.
    - Made priority values for`DefaultEventPriority` public, and changed event priority order to match the original
      Robocode game.
    - Bot event priorities can now be read and changed.
- GUI:
    - The Pause/Resume and Stop button are now disabled when the battle is stopped.
- Schema:
    - Replaced `$type` with `type` to make it possible to use more code generators
      [#31](https://github.com/robocode-dev/tank-royale/issues/31)

## 📦 0.13.4 - GUI improvements + bugfix - 06-Jun-2022

#### 🪲 Bug Fixes

- Bot API for Java:
    - Major bugfix with `getTurnRemaining()` ([#28](https://github.com/robocode-dev/tank-royale/issues/28)), which
      returned the wrong value. This could be seen with the sample bot, Crazy, which did not turn correctly.

#### Changes

- GUI:
    - **Del Key**: It is now possible to use the Del key to remove a selected bot item on the Booted Bots (to unboot),
      Joined Bots, and Selected Bot lists when selecting bots for a new battle.
    - **Unboot All**: An `← Unboot All` button has been added right below the `← Unboot` button.
    - **TPS**:
        - The last used TPS (Turns Per Second) is now restored when starting up the GUI again.
        - Added a "Default TPS" button to reset the TPS to the default setting (30 TPS).
    - **Tool tips**: Added tool tip texts on the Control panel.

      stop bot after finishing)
    - Fix for `setForward(POSITIVE_INFINITE)` which moved the bot slowly forward with no
      acceleration ([#26](https://github.com/robocode-dev/tank-royale/issues/26)).
    - Fixed issue where the event queue was not disabled if `run()` method threw an exception, causing the event queue
      to reach its max limit of unprocessed 256 events.
    - Fixed issue with events being handled 1 turn later than they
      happened ([#8](https://github.com/robocode-dev/tank-royale/issues/8))
- Bot API for Java:

    - The id was removed from `BotResults`, and `GameEndedEvent` will only return a single `BotResult` containing
      the battle results for the bot (instead of a list containing results from all bots).
    - Added setting and getting 'adjusting radar for body turn'.
    - The `scan()` and `setScan()` methods were renamed to `rescan()` and `setRescan()`.
    - Added `setInterruptible(boolean interruptible)` / `Interruptable = [bool]` to allow restarting an event handler

## 📦 0.11.0 - Initial position feature - 02-Apr-2022

#### 🪲 Bug Fixes

- Fixes for building Java artifacts to deploy to Maven artifactory.
- Bot API:
    - Replaced the environment variable BOT_URL (deprecated) with BOT_HOMEPAGE.
- Bot API for .Net:
    - Added missing public Bot(BotInfo, Uri, string serverSecret) constructor.

#### Changes

- Implemented initial position feature:
    - Add an `initialPosition` field in the JSON file for your bot with a value like `50,50,90` to request a starting
      coordinate at (50,50) with the bot heading toward 90°.
    - A `--enable-initial-position` (or the short version `-I`) must be set to enable the initial positions feature on
      the server. If initial position is not enabled, the bot will start at a random position.
    - Initial positions can be set from the menu with Config → Debug Options → Enable initial start position.
    - The Target.json file of the Target sample has been updated with an `initialPosition` to demonstrate this feature.
- Updated the SpinBot sample bot for C# to demonstrate the use of `BotInfo.FromConfiguration(IConfiguration)`.
- The config file named `misc.properties` has been renamed into `config.properties` and the `server-url` setting was
  moved to the `server.properties` file.
